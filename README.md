# Udacity Deep Learning Course

Solutions for the Course Assignments.

The repository contains my solutions for the assignments of [Udacity Deep Learning course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730).

Each assignment contains two ipython notebook files
* File name with word ```original``` is the original assignment question (unmodified). For example, ```1_notmnist_original.ipynb``` is the first assignment.
* File name without word ```original``` is the modified version in which the solution is added into it.For example, ```1_notmnist.ipynb``` is the modfied one which contains the solution to it.

```Note:``` All the description for all the assignments are given in the ipython notebooks themselves.
